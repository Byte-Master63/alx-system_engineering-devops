# 0x0C-web_server

This project is part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering program and focuses on setting up and configuring a basic web server. In this project, I learned how to create a functional web server, configure it for optimal performance, and ensure it serves basic static content over HTTP.

## Project Overview

The goal of the `0x0C-web_server` project is to create a simple web server using Nginx. The web server will serve static content, handle incoming HTTP requests, and be configured for performance and security.

Key tasks include:

- Installing and configuring the Nginx web server
- Setting up a basic configuration to serve static files
- Understanding how to handle HTTP requests and responses
- Securing the server by implementing basic firewall rules
- Creating a simple script to automate the setup process

## Requirements

- A Linux-based virtual machine (Ubuntu 20.04 or higher is recommended)
- Basic knowledge of Nginx web server and HTTP protocols
- Experience with SSH and system configuration tools like `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall)
  
## Project Files

- `0x0C-web_server.sh`: A shell script to automate the installation and setup of Nginx and necessary configurations.
- `nginx.conf`: The main configuration file for the Nginx web server.
- `index.html`: A simple HTML file to test the web server
