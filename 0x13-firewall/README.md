# 0x13. Firewall

## Description
This project is part of the ALX software engineering curriculum, focusing on the concept of **firewalls**. A firewall is a network security system designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The main objective of this project is to create and configure a firewall on a virtual machine (VM), learning the best practices for securing a systemâ€™s network by controlling which ports are accessible and defining which services can be accessed externally.

## Project Requirements
In this project, you will:
- Set up a firewall on a Linux-based virtual machine using `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall).
- Restrict access to specific ports.
- Implement firewall rules to allow/deny services based on IP addresses and port numbers.
- Ensure proper configuration to prevent unauthorized access to the machine.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain hands-on experience with configuring firewall rules.
- Understand how to secure a server by controlling network access.
- Learn about the tools available to implement a firewall in a Linux-based environment.
- Understand the importance of restricting access to only necessary services.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this project, you should:
- Be familiar with Linux-based systems and the command line.
- Understand basic networking concepts (IP addresses, ports, protocols).
- Have a working knowledge of `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) or similar firewall tools.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x13-firewall.git
   cd 0x13-firewall
